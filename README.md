**Looking for hypergrowth startups to go all-in on**

My tldr
- Engineer #5 in UiPathâ€™s first generative AI team, developed an AI agent that can execute automations, perform RAG, and interact with browsers
- Launched an AI agent (citadelagent.ai) that analyzes macro with 62 unique users ($62,000 in total access value), $6.5M peak market cap for the associated token, top 0.33% TVL on Virtuals Protocol (largest crypto agent launchpad), and 1.4k followers on X within 2 weeks of launch
- First author of [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09453v1) research paper on EEG-GAN models, placed 1st in the NeurotechX competition, and open sourced the pytorch library I developed to build this gen ai model
